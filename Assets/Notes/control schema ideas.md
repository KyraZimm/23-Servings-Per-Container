** DESIGN KEYSTONEA **
Kyra
-  My thought process is, we want this character to feel fast and punchy. Like it has some mass behind it, but can move quickly
-  Since the needle is such a focus, we want to get the jump + needle throw feeling as smooth as possible. Facilitate making it as easy as possible for player to move quickly so they can always get to needle position a couple seconds after it's been thrown

** CONTROL SCHEME IDEAS **

-  try a left/right dash, maybe with either Q/E or spacebar
-  automatic wall cling when touching a wall off the ground, instead of holding A/D
-  double jump vs. extended floaty jump vs. standard jump
-  diff wall slides & a potential version w/o wall slide
